Welcome to the dogecider v0.1 - the decision making script for indecisive people.
This simple script will enable you and your lackadaisical friends to choose one of any given list of options in a weighted pseudo-random manner.

***********************************************

The princple is simple:
1. Enter the number of people in the group.
2. Each person enters the options they offer, along with a preference score for each option.
3. The program makes a weighted pseudo-random decision as to what option you're all going to follow through.

Note: it is pretty easy to weight a choice towards what you want by giving it a high preference score - but if you already have a strong preference for a give option, then why the hell are you using the dogecider?

Such indecision. Much solution. Wow.

Ctrl+D to exit at any given point.

# Other things needed:
# Figure out rest of autofill using tab autocompletion ("readline" module) / autocompleter function.
# "Re-choose" option
# "Edit/Remove specific choices/entries"
# "Save decision making session"
# "Re-open and edit decision making session"
# Ideally we should have a live display of each user, the options they enter and the relative preference score for each.
